The jupyter notebooks inside this folder illustrates the usage of PÃ©rez-Cruz's estimator.

*KLD_for_EP_inference*: notebook containing the Gillespie simulation of a Markov process, its transition-based coarse-graining (which hides information) and the entropy production rate inference. The latter requires KLD evaluations.

*KLD_from_data*: notebook that imports two timeseries from a biological system (testdata) and analyze the KLD. Comparison with the standard method shows that the convergence is unbiased and, with such a finite dataset, the result is much closer to the expected value. The data comes from DOI:10.1088/1367-2630/ac0f18, it features forward and backward oscillation timeseries of the bullfrog's hair-bundle, which are used to quantify irreversibility.
